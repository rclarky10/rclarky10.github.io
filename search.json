    "text": "Using Form 4 timestamps scraped from EDGAR, we examine whether the intraday timing of insider trading disclosure signals trade informativeness. Supporting a strategic disclosure interpretation, we document that sales are more often disclosed in the evening, particularly among higher level insiders. Evening disclosed trades better predict earnings surprises and stock returns. Evening disclosure is particularly effective at identifying informed selling, with the signal’s value decaying over time. Leveraging insider trading coverage by Dow Jones and the signatory of the filing, we propose both improvements in information dissemination and corporate governance as channels which mitigate the value of strategic disclosure."

Withholding is more informative in the presence of greater information asymmetry surrounding the firm and following personal tax rate changes within the insider’s state of residence. Examining the extent to which withholding reflects opportunism, we find that, during blackout trading periods, withholdings are more likely to occur and more predictive of earnings announcement surprises than sales. Opportunistic insiders change their election choice more frequently, and the informativeness of withholding is lower in the year of an SEC enforcement action even though withholding is never the focus of such investigations.\n\nRevise & Resubmit at The Journal of Accounting Research\nPresented at Presented at the University of North Carolina Tax Symposium (2025); Midwest Finance Association Annual Meeting (2025); Eastern Finance Association Annual Meeting (2025); Southwestern Finance Association Annual Meeting (2025); Southern Finance Association Annual Meeting (2024); Silicon Prairie Finance Conference (2024)\nUniversity of Kansas, School of Business Best Paper Award (2024)\n\n\n\n\n(with Will Bazley, Yosef Bonaparte, and Carina Cuculiza)\nWe experimentally examine whether artificial intelligence-generated information about aggregate risk influences households’ economic expectations and behavior. Randomly assigning recession forecasts from artificial intelligence (AI) models and professionals, we exogenously shift individuals’ beliefs. Participants update their recession expectations in response to AI forecasts, placing similar weight on them as on professional forecasts. Households extrapolate their AI-influenced recession beliefs to other dimensions of their macroeconomic and microeconomic outlooks.

Our findings indicate that households perceive AI-generated macroeconomic information signals as credible and behaviorally relevant.\n\nPresented at the Southwestern Finance Association Annual Meeting (2026)\n\n\n\n\n(with Justin Balthrop and Jonathan Bitting)\nIn recent years, company filings have featured a notable rise in anti-short selling rhetoric. This paper investigates whether changes in such language help explain fluctuations in abnormal insider equity sales. Despite disclosures suggesting an artificially suppressed stock price, we estimate a 70% increase in the probability of an insider sale following the use of certain buzzwords in public company filings, a result that contrasts with established theory. These insider sales often precede significant stock price declines and correlate with future accounting restatements, suggesting potential private information and timing effects. Additionally, we provide evidence that this rhetoric influences retail investors, who engage in increased discussion and purchases of a firm’s stock after it employs anti-short selling language.\n\nPresented at the Financial Management Association Annual Meeting (2025); Southern Finance Association Annual Meeting (2025); University of Kansas\n\n\n\n\n(with Felix Meschke and Jide Wintoki)\nInsider trading profits are often attributed to access to material, nonpublic information. We develop a novel classification framework to distinguish which insider trades are more likely to reflect proprietary insights rather than public valuation signals. Using the asset pricing method of Bartram and Grinblatt (2018), we benchmark insider trades against those a value investor would make based solely on financial statement data. We find that while many insider trades appear to contain insider-specific information, those that diverge from public fundamentals—what we label proprietary trades—appear to contain more. Our findings challenge the assumption that higher profitability implies greater use of private information and offer a new lens for evaluating insider activity.\n\nPresented at the Financial Management Association Annual Meeting (2024); University of Kansas\nUniversity of Kansas John O.
